1. As an employee I want to be able to register new customers.
2. As a customer I want to be able to buy products.
3. As an employee I want to be able to get a statistic over a given period,
which shows how many different customers we had, how many products
were sold during this period and how much the products cost on
average.
4. As an employee I want to be able to add new products to the inventory.
