== Feature branches
=== get-product-information
Implemented feature: You can get the full information of a product (price, quantityInStock, eanCode, ...)
here: `GET /api/products/{id}`

=== add-purchase-history
Implemented feature: Endpoint, where you can see all the purchases (product name, total price, quantity, purchase date)
made by a customer:
`GET /api/customers/getHistory/{id}`

== Web sockets
If you go to http://localhost:8080/api/ you can "log in" (just enter some name and press `connect`).
After that you can order some Products (we only have products that have `glasses` or `contacts` in their name).
After that the order is being processed (program waits 0 - 5 seconds).Then you will get
an answer, either that your product is ready, or that we do not own that product.


== API Documentation

When you run the application, you can find the documentation of the api here

http://localhost:8080/api/q/swagger-ui

1. As an employee I want to be able to register new customers.
2. As a customer I want to be able to buy products.
3. As an employee I want to be able to get a statistic over a given period,
which shows how many different customers we had, how many products
were sold during this period and how much the products cost on
average.
4. As an employee I want to be able to add new products to the inventory.

Regarding testing in karate I tested one endpoint in this project (InvoiceResourceTest).
